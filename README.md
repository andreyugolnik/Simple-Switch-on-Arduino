# Simple-Switch-on-Arduino

This program was written for Arduino after watching a video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxYyP1PEU7I).

General modifications:

1. Antenna LED and first switch LED merged.
2. Built-in pull-up resistor used.
3. All buttons processed "in parallel".
4. Completely refactored program.
